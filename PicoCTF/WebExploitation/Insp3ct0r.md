Insp3ct0r &rarr; F12\
I found this hope in html document :grin:

``` html
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```

It says I have 1/3 flag. So I need 2/3 more. Some other hopes that I found at the above:
``` html
<p>I used these to make this site: <br>
	  HTML <br>
	  CSS <br>
	  JS (JavaScript)
	</p>
```
So I can assume that 1/3 I have is what thing i can have if I inspect html document, others are in css and js file.

Go to source tab, open mycss.css file and I got second part of the flag:
``` css
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```
Open myjs.js file, get final part:
``` js
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?832b0699} */
```
Assemble 3 part of the flag &rarr; mission complete :grin: :
