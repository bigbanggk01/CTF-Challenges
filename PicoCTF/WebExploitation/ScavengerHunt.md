``` html
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```
That seem I have got 1/3 of the flag. Go to source tab and get second part in mycss.css file.
``` css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```
Part 3 seem in js file. No~~  it just a hint.
``` js
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```
Ok, go to google and ask him "how you can index my web site google?" :pig: Stupid but make sense. Google use robots.txt file. So go to that file at /robots.txt and get the final part.
``` url
