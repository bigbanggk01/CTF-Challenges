# Scavenger Hunt - PicoCTF challenge

* **PicoCTF**: *https://play.picoctf.org/*
* **Description**: There is some interesting information hidden around this site. Can you find it?
---

Some hope will display using F12 button on your keyboard :grin:
``` html
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```
That seem I have got 1/3 of the flag. Go to source tab and get second part in mycss.css file.
``` css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```
Part 3 seem in js file. No~~  it just a hint.
``` js
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```
Ok, go to google and ask him "how you can index my web site google?" :pig: Stupid but make sense. Google use robots.txt file. So go to that file at /robots.txt and get the final part.
``` bash
http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/robots.txt

User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```
Another hope here, Apache Server + "Access" in upcase? &rarr; .htaccess :neutral_face:.
``` bash
http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/.htaccess

# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```
I need to find next flag using the hope above. Although I haven't used Mac, it still easy because this hope is understandable. :pig:
``` bash
http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/.DS_Store
