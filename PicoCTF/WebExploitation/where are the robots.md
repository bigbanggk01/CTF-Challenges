# Where are the robots - PicoCTF challenge

* **PicoCTF**: *https://play.picoctf.org/*
* **Description**: Can you find the robots?

---
The question in description hint that I need to go to /robots.txt URI.
``` bash
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/robots.txt
```
I got a weird directory
``` bash
User-agent: *
Disallow: /477ce.html
```
Just keep trying, go to that URI.
``` bash
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/477ce.html
```
