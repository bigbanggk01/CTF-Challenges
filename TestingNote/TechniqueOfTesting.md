# Testing techniques :man_technologist:
## Static
* Static Analysis
* Review

## Dynamic
* Black-box testing
  * Equivalence Partitioning
    * The technique that devides the input data of software unit into partitions of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived.
    * Two partitions: 0-5 and 5-10 &rarr; Choose 1 representative value for each partition because of all values in a partition have the same meaning. Ex: -4,1,7,15
    
  * Boundary Values Analysis
    * 
  * Dicision Table

* White-box testing
  * T
* Experience-based
  * 
* Defect-based
* Dynamic analysis
